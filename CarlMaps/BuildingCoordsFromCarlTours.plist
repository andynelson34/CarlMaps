            <string>Berg House is a college-owned house located at 112 Union St. (the corner of Union St. and 2nd St.), on the same block as Dacie Moses House. It is an interest house that houses 8 students. Since the 1998-1999 school year, it has been the home of WA House, an institutional house.
            Berg House is a mostly brick building and has been described as a box that sits on top of another box. The top floor is one large room, a triple. The main floor has the remainder of the student rooms (a double and three singles), and a bathroom. Interestingly, all of the common rooms are in the basement, which includes a large lounge, the kitchen, study rooms, a larger bathroom, and the laundry machines.
            Berg was home to Sci-Fi House for four years, from the 1994-1995 school year to the 1997-1998 school year. Since the 1998-1999 school year, it has been the home of WA House.
            Cable TV was first installed in Berg in 1995. This was, at the time, the only student housing to have cable (and the only cable TV on campus other than the lounge in Sayles-Hill), which was somewhat contraversial at the time. Because the SFA was charged with recording and archiving science fiction shows, Sci-Fi house was allowed this unique luxury. Since then, cable has become much more common in campus housing.</string>

            <string>Burton Hall is a residence hall located on the west side of Carleton's campus. It has four stories, plus a basement. It is part of the Burton-Sevy-Davis complex and houses Burton Dining Hall in its basement.
            Burton was built in 1915 as the first men's dormitory. It was designed by the Chicago firm of Patton, Holmes and Flinn. In 1938, the fourth floor was remodeled using a design by John S. Van Begen, a Chicago architect who served as Superintendent of Buildings. Burton is well known for its triples. At the end of each hallway there are two two-room triples, and interspersed throughout the rest of the building there are large "suites" (often with one big room for desks and living, and one small room for beds) that accommodate three people.
            Nearly every Burton floor has been referred to as a notorious party floor. First Burton is especially well known for its wild parties on both Fridays and Saturdays.
            Fourth Burton has been called "Fifth Burton" because it was "so high," but it was cleaned and converted to substance-free status for the 2004-2005 academic year.
            First Burton is the most heavily trafficked dorm floor at Carleton primarily due to its connection to Sayles.</string>

            <string>Opened in 2009, Cassat Hall was built to offer more on-campus rooms and to be a model of energy efficiency.
            
A companion residence hall next to Cassat was first called Memorial Hall and in 2012, renamed James Hall. The two buildings were awarded LEED Gold certification in 2010.
They were designed by LHB Architects.

The two residences offer housing to 230 students.</string>

            <string>Chaney House is an off-campus house that may be granted as an interest house. It is located at 115 Maple Street/701 East Second Street. It is currently the home of Knight House, but was for several years previous the home of WHOA House.
            Chaney House is named for Lucian Chaney, class of 1907 and former science professor at Carleton, who laid the groundwork for the Biology Department and the Geology Department. The house was built circa 1870. Carleton purchased it from the Dike family in 1940 for use as faculty housing. It has been used for student housing since 1973.
            Chaney House was for many years the home of CANOE House, then known as Outhouse, until CANOE was denied the house for the 1994-1995 school year, being granted Farm House instead. Several years' worth of accumulated outdoors equipment had to be removed from the house at that time. In spring of 2007 WHOA was denied the house for debatable reasons.</string>

            <string>Cowling Gymnasium was built in 1965, as a women's gymnasium and physical education facility. It was named for College President Donald J. Cowling's wife, Elizabeth.
Cowling was generally referred to as "Women's Rec" in the 70's.
The building was designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the architect who also designed the fourth floor addition to Myers Hall, Goodhue Hall, the West Gym, Olin Hall, and Watson Hall. (Yamasaki also designed the World Trade Center in New York.)
            Dances are held in Cowling each term.</string>

            <string>The Dacie Moses House is an off-campus house managed by Alumni Affairs located at 110 Union Street, half a block south of Musser Hall. It was built in 1870 by Ira Sumner. In 1922, Dacie Moses and her husband Royal Moses '04 moved into the house. Dacie worked at Carleton from 1919 to 1969, first in the Treasurer's Office and later in the library. Upon her retirement in she was awarded an honorary Masters Degree by the college.
            Royal Moses was a member of a community a cappella singing group that used the house as rehearsal space beginning in 1936. Campus singing groups continued that tradition after Royal's death in 1960. Beginning in 1947, friends and students began gathering at the Moses home for Sunday brunch, a tradition that continued after Royal's death. When Dacie died in 1981, she left the house to Carleton so "that the Carleton Alumni Association use said homestead in substantially the same manner as it was used during my lifetime..."
Since that time students have lived in the Dacie Moses House with the task of keeping the house available for student groups, cookie bakers, and Sunday brunches.
            The House continues to be a home to students and a hostel for guests. As with any 135 year old structure, the house is in need of large scale renovation. The costs will be huge if the college continues to use the house as it does now.</string>

            <string>Davis Hall was built in 1923 as the second men's dormitory. It was designed by Patton, Holmes and Flinn a Chicago architectural firm that designed a number of Carleton buildings in the early 20th century.
            For many years it was the residence for freshmen men. At a later date, Musser Hall and Davis housed first year men. Davis is now, like all dorms, co-ed. First Davis is currently a quiet floor and fourth Davis is currently substance free. Davis is the southernmost portion of The Complex, and is connected on the first floor to Burton Hall. All Davis rooms have the luxury of private bathrooms.
            Davis rooms come with a closet, two chests of drawers, two beds, and ethernet access. Unfortunately, Davis was one of the first buildings wired for ethernet, thus in some areas it has older wiring and may not reach peak 100mbs speeds. Davis rooms are fairly spacious, some even have bay windows. Most of the Davis interior is woodwork, although the building has been redone recently. One major purported benefit to Davis is its mystical heaters that have been known to blow cold air during the hotter parts of the year. Unlike some dorms, Davis heaters can be controlled from the rooms.
            The majority of Davis residents are juniors and seniors due to the prestige attached to the dorm. A few freshmen are present on each floor. Composed mostly of doubles, Davis also houses several quints that are quite large and highly sought after. Each floor is slightly different, for example, fourth has a much larger lounge than the others, while third has an open lounge. Floor plan for the building can be found here.
            Although it used to be residential, ground Davis now houses the Wellness Center.</string>

            <string>Evans Hall was built as a women's dormitory in 1927 and named for Margaret Evans. It was designed by Patton, Holmes and Flinn a Chicago architectural firm that designed a number of Carleton buildings in the early 20th century.
            The floor plan is designed around vertical columns of rooms rather than floors. There are numerous misconceptions about this layout, many of which revolve around the idea of minimizing gossip; the design, in fact, was inspired by a Harvard residence hall built at the time, and the columns were designed to reduce noise by minimizing the opportunities to socialize in the halls.
            In November 2011, the college announced plans to renovate Evans. The project began in December 2011 in the unused kitchen area. Most work began in June 2012, after reunion weekend. Evans reopened at the beginning of winter term 2013.
            The renovation will add "40 beds" to the campus' housing.
            Additional off-campus programs were offered during fall term of 2012 to temporarily reduce housing demand.</string>

            <string>Faculty Club is a series of three interconnected buildings located at 715-721 East Second Street. As their name implies, they were once used for employee housing, but are now used to house students. It is considered to be an off-campus house and is available to upperclassmen at Room Draw.
Faculty Club has 24/7 "Quiet Hours." For that reason, it is traditionally inhabited by particularly studious students.
            Faculty Club was created by superintendent of grounds D. Blake Stewart in the 1920s by merging three houses together. One was already on site, a second was shifted several feet into position, and the third was moved from down the street.[1]
For many years, Faculty Club was used to house bachelor members of the faculty. A kitchen and dining room offered meals for residents and their guests.</string>

            <string>Farm House is an off-campus house that is one of two houses encompassed by Sustainable Living House (the other being Parr House). Its offical address is Rural Route 2, Highway 19.
            Farm house is one of the few off-campus houses that was originally built as student housing. Carleton built Farm House in the 1920s as a place for students whose work-study would be working the dairy farm purchased from the Frank Parr family in 1914. After the dairy herd was sold in 1964, the farmland was leased to neighboring farmers.
Farm House is the traditional home of Sustainable Living House (which has been in the house so long, the interest group is usually referred to as "Farm House" as well). The group failed to turn in their interest house application for the 1994-1995 school year, and CANOE House received Farm House that year. For many years before that, and every year since then, Sustainable Living House has lived in Farm House.
Farmstock, a folk music concert and picnic put on by Carleton students, staff and alumni each spring, is held on the lawn in front of Farm House.</string>

            <string>Goodhue Hall (sometimes referred to as The 'Hue or just 'Hue, pronounced "hyoo") is the only dorm on the northeast side of Lyman Lakes. It is almost as remote from the rest of campus as the Rec Center. It was first occupied in September 1962. During the first years of use, Goodhue was occupied by sophomore and junior men. (Freshmen men were housed in Musser and Davis. Most senior men lived in Severance. Because of its separation from most of the campus, it was not the most popular dorm. The first and second floors were often occupied by groups made up primarily of jocks, that resembled informal fraternaties -- see Vigilantes and 288.
            It had a dining hall until the spring of 1999. The space was then converted into a large lounge known as the Superlounge.</string>

            <string>Goodsell Observatory is one of the oldest buildings on Carleton's campus. It is on the National Register of Historical Places. It formerly housed the Astronomy Department and later the Mathematics and Astronomy Department. Then it housed the Mathematics and Computer Science Department until the CMC was built. It is now home to the Linguistics Department.
            The larger dome contains a 16" refractor, and the smaller dome contains an 8" refractor. When the 16" telescope was installed in 1890, it was the 12th largest in the world. Goodsell was also an important site for astronomy in the late 19th century because of its transit telescope, which it used to set time for railroads throughout the northwest.
The 16" and 8" telescopes are still used regularly during open houses, which occur on the first Friday of every month. Goodsell also contains modern 8" telescopes, which are used for classes and open houses. During observations, they are mounted on stands located on the east lawn of the observatory.
In addition, Goodsell houses the school's meteorite collection. A major addition to the collection came from Harvey H. Nininger, who gave them to pay for his daughter's tuition, Margaret Ann Nininger '46. He had made similar arrangements with Amherst and Grinnell for other children.
            Weather permitting, an open house is held at Goodsell on the first Friday of the month, beginning after dark and lasting for two hours. The upcoming schedule can be visited here. This open house is open to the public as well as to Carleton students.</string>

            <string>The Laurence McKinley Gould Library is the main library of Carleton College. It is most commonly referred to by Carleton students as either "the Library" or simply "the Libe." It was constructed in 1956 and named in honor of Laurence Gould, former geology professor and president of the college.
The original building was designed by Magney, Tusler and Setter of Minneapolis. The 1983 additions were designed by Sovik, Mathre, Sathrum and Quanbeck of Northfield. It is located between Leighton Hall and Laird Hall.</string>

            <string>Hall House is an off-campus house located at 210-212 East First Street. It is an interest house and currently the home of La Casa del Sol.
            Hall House was purchased by the college in 1922, when it was located a couple hundred feet northwest of its current site (i.e., where Musser Hall is currently). The house was moved in 1928 to its current location. It is named for the Reverend Richard Hall, one of the original members of the college's Board of Trustees and the first board chair. Carleton used the house for faculty/staff apartments until 1973, since which time it has been student housing.</string>

            <string>Hill House is a large off-campus house located at 205 College Street. It includes rooms for 25 students and is available to upperclassmen through room draw.
            Hill House was built in 1894. Fred B. Hill '00 and his wife Deborah Sayles Hill purchased it in 1907 when Hill was hired by his alma mater as a professor of Biblical Literature. The Hills lived in the house until 1913, when they sold it to Carleton and moved down the block to the new home they had just built, which is now known as Parish House. Hill House then became the president's residence, and President Donald Cowling lived there from 1914 until his retirement in 1945. It has been student housing since that time.</string>

Football games are played here in the fall as well as track and field events in the spring. In addition, the stadium holds some offices for the athletic department and 22 student rooms. It is typically referred to as Stadium (no definite article) to avoid confusion with Laird Hall.
            Stadium was filled to capacity only once, when General Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke in 1952 while a candidate for US President.</string>

The building opened in 2001. It was designed by Moore/Andersson Architects of Austin, Texas, and cost approximately $14 million to construct. It was a part of President Steve Lewis' Assuring Excellence campaign.
            The LDC is also one of the more confusing buildings on campus, containing a maze of hallways, stairwells, offices, and common spaces in a design best described as "fractal" 
            It holds the East Dining Hall and various language departments.</string>

            <string>The Music and Drama Center, sometimes abbreviated M and D, consists of two buildings, the Concert Hall and Arena Theater above ground, but it was designed and built as one unit with a common basement and foundation. It was dedicated in 1971 in conjunction with the inauguration of President Swearer.
            Design work on the M and D began in 1959, ten years before the actual groundbreaking. It was located where Gridley Hall stood before it was demolished in 1967, and part of Gridley's foundation can reportedly still be seen in the tunnels near the M and D. Construction began in 1969 and was completed the following year.
Almost immediately, structural problems and design flaws became evident with the building(s). The underground practice rooms leaked when it rained, and the roof of Arena was structurally unsound (and even now, any curtain or scrim that is to hang down over the stage is required to be hung from the catwalks, not from the ceiling itself). The college found itself paying for extensive repairs on both buildings, and by 1978 had hired an attorney to attempt to recoup money from the architect and builders. In 1984, a settlement of over $2.4 million was paid to Carleton—considerably less than what had already been paid in repairs and lost in other costs.</string>

            <string>Nutting House was built in 1889 for John C. Nutting, who was then president of the First National Bank of Northfield. Before the construction of the first dormitory for men (Burton in 1915), the Nuttings rented rooms in the house to male Carleton students.
The house and its furnishings were donated to Carleton in April of 1970 by Helen Nutting '40 and Ruth Nutting '42, as a residence for the college's president at the time, Howard R. Swearer. According to Eric Hillemann, college archivist, the house was given to Carleton "as a Memorial to John Claudius Nutting, Elizabeth Adams Nutting and Laura Morse Nutting."
In spite of the family's history of boarding students, the Nutting sisters stated in 1970, their "hopes and expectations that this house will be used by the College for the residence of the President, desiring that it remain as residential property. We do hope it will not be used for other purposes, for instance, offices or dormitories." The house has been the college president's residence since then.</string>

            <string>Parish House, also known as Language House, is Carleton's largest interest house. It is located on 419 East Third Street, a few blocks away from campus. It should not be confused with Parr House, a much smaller house that is currently used as an extension of Farm House.
            
            Parish House was built in 1912 as the private home of Fred Burnett Hill, class of 1900, and Deborah Sayles Hill. In 1907 the Hills came to Northfield when Fred became a professor of Biblical Literature at Carleton. (The couple also donated the money to build Sayles-Hill Gymnasium.)
            Parish House had a private gymnasium, a pool room, and tennis courts. A large dining room and kitchen complex occupied much of the first floor. The west side of the ground floor included the living room, Professor Hill's study, and a large library. Family and guest rooms were on the second floor. Servants' quarters were on the third floor. Professor Hill died in 1919. Mrs. Hill sold the propterty to the Northfield Methodists, who moved their church to the lawn east of the house. The mansion was used as a "parish house" and church school.
            In 1963, Carleton bought all the Methodist property on the block, the parish house, the old church, the parsonage, and the garage in back, for a price of $62,500. For a time in the mid-'60s, space in Parish House was rented to the Northfield public schools for use as classroom space, pending completion of the new high school.
            After the Methodist congregation moved to their new building in 1966, the old church was demolished. Carleton remodeled Parish House into a dormitory. Originally it was used as a men's language house, one section for French speakers another for German speakers.</string>

            <string>Parr House is a small house whose official address is Rural Route 2, Highway 19. It is the furthest house from the center of campus, an interest house currently used, along with Farm House, as a home of Sustainable Living House.
            Parr House is named for Frank Parr, who sold a dairy herd to the college in 1914. The dairy farm was located on the land around Parr House and Farm House.
Parr eventually became student housing. Sci-Fi House was run out of Parr for its first year, 1993-1994. It was used as the Arb Office for a time in the late 1990s, until the Modern Language Center was moved to its current site and became the new Arb Office. Since that time, it returned to student housing and has been a second home to Sustainable Living House.</string>

            <string>Severance Hall is a dormitory and administrative building in the center of campus.
It was built in 1928 at a cost of $330,000. Furnishings added another 20% to the cost of the building. It was designed by the Chicago firm of Patton, Holmes and Flinn.
The building was named for Cordenio Severance and Mary F. Severance, class of 1880. They bequeathed $100,000 to the college in 1925.
Severance included offices for the Dean of Men, a public dining hall known as the Tea Room, Great Hall, guest suites, private dining rooms and rooms for senior men. (Davis Hall was reserved for freshmen men, and Burton Hall was the residence for sophomore and junior men.) Most Severance rooms were well appointed and some originally rented at premium rates.
The Tea Room closed as a public dining room in the 1970s and is now considered to be part of Burton Dining Hall.</string>

            <string>Skinner Memorial Chapel was built in 1916. It was designed by Patton, Holmes and Flinn a Chicago architectural firm that designed a number of Carleton buildings in the early 20th century. Located next to the Bald Spot, it was the tallest building on campus at the time until the construction of Watson Hall, making it now the second-tallest.
The Skinner Chapel is used not only for religious services held by various denominations on campus, but also for events that require large seating, such as DVD Fest 2006. Each week's convocation is held in the Chapel, and several notable speakers have delivered speeches in it.</string>

            <string>Strong House is a college-owned house located at 118 College Street (the corner of Second Street and College Street). It houses the college's Human Resources department, as well as apartments for faculty.
            Strong House was originally the home of Carleton's first president, James W. Strong. He built the house in 1875 and sold it to his son Edward in 1912. The home passed through the hands of several different families after that time until the college purchased it in 1971.</string>

            <string>The water tower at Carleton has been the subject of many pranks and repaintings. Current school policy sets a $100 fine for climbing the water tower, due to the risk of injury or death, and charges students who repaint the water tower for the cost of repainting it. [1] In recent years, repainting the tower typically happens very soon after students have painted it. (But in the past, student contributions were more tolerated.) One of the most famous instances of painting the water tower happened the night before President Clinton's address at the commencement of 2000.
The water tower was decorated for Earth Day 2005. The colorful world map attached to the water tower was unfortunately applied so the west edge of the map was at the top. The map was still on the water tower three weeks later.</string>

            <string>Watson Hall is a residence hall located on the east side of Carleton's campus. It has seven stories, plus a basement. Watson was built as a women's dorm in 1966 and first occupied during April 1967, when Gridley was about to be destroyed.[1] Its use as a women's dorm is evidenced by the now-unused built-in front desk, formerly used for checking students in and out.
The building was designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the architect who also designed Goodhue Hall, the West Gym, Cowling, Olin, and the fourth floor addition to Myers Hall. (Yamasaki also designed the World Trade Center in New York.)
            Watson has seven floors, each holding about 40 students.</string>

            <string>The Weitz Center for Creativity is the interdisciplinary arts center created by Carleton College in the complex that previously housed the Northfield Middle School. The project had been referred to as the Arts Union.
            Carleton purchased the former Northfield Middle School in September 2005. The buildings had been empty for two years after the construction of a new middle school on the south edge of Northfield.
            The Carleton purchase occurred after an unsuccessful attempt by arts groups in the city to create a studio, performance, and residence center for Northfield artists. Foundation grants and government subsidies necessary for funding the project failed to materialize.
            The Carleton press release announcing the purchase stated that it was the college’s hope to create “a first-rate interdisciplinary arts center for the college... [and] a much deeper connection between Carleton's arts curriculum and the Northfield community.”

            The building complex consisted of a 1910 building that was originally Northfield High School, a 1934 auditorium addition, and 1954 additions of a gymnasium, a cafeteria, and a classroom wing.</string>

            <string>West Gym was built in 1964 as a replacement for Sayles-Hill Gymnasium.
The building was designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the architect who also designed the fourth floor addition to Myers Hall, Goodhue Hall, Olin, Cowling, and Watson Hall. (Yamasaki also designed the World Trade Center in New York.)
Before the Music and Drama Center was built, from time to time, West Gym was pressed into service for Carleton Student Association concert bookings for groups such as Judy Collins, Ian and Sylvia, and "It's A Beautiful Day."
The building houses the school's competition basketball court, Thorpe Pool, a wrestling training room, an athletic-training room, and offices for some of the athletic coaches and staff. It is located next to Laird Stadium</string>

            <string>Willis Hall is the current center for many social sciences (and education) classes, located next to Sayles-Hill. It was first completed in 1872, but rebuilt or remodeled in 1880 and 1953.
            In 1869, construction began on what would be named Willis Hall. The building was designed by the firm of Alden and Howe of Minneapolis. It was completed in 1872 and is the oldest building on campus. Originally it housed the college's classrooms, offices, chapel, men's dormitory, and cabinet. Until the construction of Williams Hall in 1881, the college was located in Willis Hall.
When dedicated in 1872, the building was named for Susan Willis Carleton, a significant benefactor and wife of William Carleton.
In 1879, the building was either destroyed or badly damaged by fire (the available records are unclear about that) and it was rebuilt in 1880. Six years later the bells were added.

In 1953, Willis was extensively remodeled and became a student center. Until the renovation of Sayles-Hill in 1979, Willis housed the post office and the book store in the basement, a snack bar on the first floor, student lounges on the first and second floors, and offices for student activities. Campus radio station KARL and the Algol had offices on the top floor. The Carletonian office was on the third floor.</string>
