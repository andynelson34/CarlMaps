CARLMAPS

ABOUT:
CarlMaps is a map app for Carleton's campus and arb, designed to make up for the
lack of coverage of this area by Google and Apple Maps. The user is able to search
a list of locations and select one to drop a pin on that location, which also
displays the location name. The user can also use the Trails menu to display any
number of arb trails on the map, and to turn these overlays on and off in any
combination. There is also a "Current Location" button in the lower right corner,
which centers the map on the user's location.

PROJECT STATUS:
All the features of CarlMaps work as intended, except that the map and trails overlays
take a long time to load sometimes. This occasionally results in memory warnings
followed by the app running out of memory and exiting to the home screen, if the
user is moving the view around and zooming in and out a lot. While we couldn't
find a solution to this problem given how late in development it started occurring,
it is unlikely to happen in normal use, since users will typically only be selecting
a single location at once and then traveling to that location over a period of time,
with the map staying stationary.

GETTING STARTED:
Simply run the app! If you're running it on a computer, you may have to manually
input current location GPS coordinates into the simulator to simulate location,
but location tracking works perfectly on an actual device.
